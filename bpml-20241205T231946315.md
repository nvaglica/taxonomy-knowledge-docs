Business Process BPML Components
BPML code includes activities and elements that work together in a business process. An activity is a step in a business process and may be comprised of multiple elements. Elements are defined components of code that provide structure and instructions regarding the activity they embody. BPML refers to entities outside of the business process as participants. An example of a participant is an inventory system. A simple activity is a single step in a business process. A complex activity is an activity that comprises a set of steps in a business process. Activities within BPML code correspond to the icons you include in your business process models when you create them using the GPM. While an icon displays as a single, contained unit, the related BPML code shows several elements that comprise the activity. For example, the operation activity is the BPML component used to call a service within a business process. Some BPML activities are represented by icons in the GPM (such as Sequence and Choice icons), while others are included within the service icons you can select in the GPM. If you create business process models by direct-coding, you are responsible for including all the appropriate elements that make up activities. The process element defines an activity and is the root element of a business process model.
